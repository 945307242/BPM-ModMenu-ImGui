# BPM-ModMenu-ImGui
BPM Mod Menu with ImGui based on my old menu and "upgrded" it by some retards

The description of it actually says anything. 
A lot of things have changed from creation of orginal template, and there is so many shit-code by me and people who edited it (especially).
I don't accept the any issues using this project so i have disabled it.
The reason of uploading it is `fun`
